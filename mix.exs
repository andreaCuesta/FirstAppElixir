# keyword options. Weâ€™re saying here that we have the dialyxir library, the version
# must be >= 0.5.0 and < 1.0.0 , and we only need it in the dev environment


# dialyzer: [plt_add_apps: [:mix]]
# This is to avoid dialyzer complain about Mix missing functions, because with that Mix # is included in the analysis
